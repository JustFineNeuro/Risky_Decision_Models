# Risky_Decision_Models
The code repository contains matlab functions for fitting several variants of reward based utility models for risky-choice paradigms. Namely, there are 4 core model types available, and they are made up by the interesection of fitting are empirical/subjective quantities for probability and reward. The subjective probability functions effectively estimate a nonlinear transform using the Prelec function (Prelec: 1998). There are other types of nonlinear weight functions in the world, but for empirically estimating subjective value as a whole (probability x reward offer), the Prelec function generally suffices. The code is easily extensible for other types of probability functions, too. Subjective Utility (i.e., Reward) is estimated as R.^power. There's more model options if you explore the code. 

The fitting of models is done through variational bayesian approximations to parameter posteriors. This has the advantage of allowing a free-energy/Elbo model fit metric that natively integrates model complexity and fit, allowing easy model comparison and selection in terms of model posterior probability. To wit, this code relies on the VBA matlab toolbox https://mbb-team.github.io/VBA-toolbox/
